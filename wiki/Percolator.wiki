#summary Details on obtaining and using Percolator for cross-link validation.

= Introduction =

Kojak uses the Percolator algorithm to validate peptide spectrum matches and assign a q-value to all search identifications. The q-value can be used to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff. Percolator is not maintained on this site. It can be obtained for free at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/percolator/files/

Additional Percolator information is found at: http://per-colator.com/

*SPECIAL NOTE: Please use Percolator version 2.04 to analyze Kojak results. Newer versions are not compatible (yet - updates soon!)*
