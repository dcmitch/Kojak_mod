== Overview ==

Kojak produces two output files: 1) a summarized list of PSMs and scores for all spectra, and 2) an optional list of PSMs formatted for further analysis using [Percolator Percolator]. Both output files are presented in ASCII text and are tab-delimited. They can alternately be opened in most spreadsheet software (such as Microsoft Excel) for easy viewing.
