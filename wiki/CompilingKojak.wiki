== Introduction ==

Kojak is provided open source for free. Advanced users may wish to compile the source code for their custom system, or modify it for their own purposes. Below are instructions for installation on a Linux-based system using the command-line. It is assumed that SVN software is already installed on the system. Kojak can also be compiled for other operating systems/development environments including, but not limited to, Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows. Specific development environment instructions are outside the scope of this document, as it is assumed users of those environments are already familiar with them.


== Details ==

=== Step 1: Check out the Kojak repository ===
Check out the repository on the [https://code.google.com/p/kojak-ms/source/checkout Source] page. Follow the provided instructions.

=== Step 2: Check out the supporting software libraries ===
a. [https://code.google.com/p/mstoolkit/source/checkout MSToolkit] - used to support multiple file formats.

b. [https://code.google.com/p/hardklor/source/checkout Hardklor] - used for spectral processing functions.


=== Step 3: Build support software ===
Both MSToolkit and Hardklor come with Makefiles. Compile MSToolkit first. For example:

{{{
MSToolkit> make
}}}

When MSToolkit has finished building, compile Hardklor. Open the Makefile first and set the path to the MSToolkit folder. Then make Hardklor.

{{{
Hardklor> make
}}}

=== Step 4: Update paths in the Kojak Makefile ===
Open Makefile with any text editor. Edit 'MSTOOLKITPATH' and 'HARDKLORPATH' to the location of your MSToolkit and Hardklor repositories:

{{{
MSTOOLKITPATH = /yourpath/MSToolkit
HARDKLORPATH = /yourpath/Hardklor
}}}

Save the changes in the Makefile.

=== Step 5: Make Kojak ===
Type 'make' from the command line.
